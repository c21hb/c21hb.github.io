In making this webpage, I found it very cool that I can design the size, font, and layout of the page. However, I found it hard to use javascript in this setting because there are many contained perameters so it is hard to put images etc. exactly where you intend for them to go. I also had trouble changing the size and shape of the boxes, so I ended up keeping them the same way as you did, but I am trying to change that.
